# SGD-Regressor-for-Multivariate-Linear-Regression

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Import the required packages and print the present data.

2.Print the placement data and salary data.

3.Find the null and duplicate values.

4.Using logistic regression find the predicted values of accuracy,confusion matrices.

5.Display the results.

## Program:
```
